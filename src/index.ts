/**
 * @battlegrid/mcp-server — stdio proxy to BattleGrid's remote MCP server
 *
 * Reads BATTLEGRID_API_KEYS (comma-separated) or BATTLEGRID_API_KEY from
 * environment, discovers account identities via GET /mcp/identity, connects
 * to the remote BattleGrid MCP server via Streamable HTTP, and re-exposes
 * all tools, prompts, and resources over stdio transport for local MCP clients.
 *
 * Multi-account support: when multiple keys are configured, an `account`
 * enum parameter is injected into every tool so the AI agent can choose
 * which account to act as. Tool calls are routed with the matching Bearer token.
 *
 * Strategy authoring (v3): the strategy-authoring tools publish one strict
 * server-owned outer object, `{ request: canonicalPayload }`. In multi-account
 * mode the proxy adds `account` only as a sibling of `request`, producing
 * exactly `{ account, request }`; on a call it strips only `account` and
 * forwards the unchanged `{ request }`. It never descends into or reconstructs
 * the nested request — the server owns every required field, bound, union
 * discriminator, and `additionalProperties:false` constraint.
 *
 * Versions (two of them, describing two different things):
 *   - PACKAGE_VERSION — this proxy's own code. Sent UPSTREAM as the client identity.
 *   - the announced contract — read from the upstream handshake at connect time and relayed
 *     DOWNSTREAM verbatim. Never a constant compiled into this package. See `announcedIdentityOf`.
 *
 * Architecture: Matches Stripe's @stripe/mcp pattern — thin authenticated proxy.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   BATTLEGRID_API_KEY=bg_live_... npx @battlegrid/mcp-server
 *   BATTLEGRID_API_KEYS=bg_live_aaa,bg_live_bbb npx @battlegrid/mcp-server
 *
 * Environment Variables:
 *   BATTLEGRID_API_KEYS (optional) — Comma-separated list of API keys
 *   BATTLEGRID_API_KEY  (optional) — Single API key (fallback if BATTLEGRID_API_KEYS not set)
 *   BATTLEGRID_API_URL  (optional) — Override server URL (default: https://mcp.battlegrid.trade/mcp)

 * that will actually serve the calls makes the pairing true by construction, on every connection,
 * with no release involved.
 *
 * VERBATIM, NOT RECONSTRUCTED. `Implementation` also carries optional display metadata (`title`,
 * `websiteUrl`, `icons`, …). Passing the object through means a field the server adds later reaches
 * local clients without an edit here — the same reason the tool catalog is never enumerated.
 *
 * FAILS CLOSED. `serverInfo` is required in a successful MCP `initialize` result, so a connected
